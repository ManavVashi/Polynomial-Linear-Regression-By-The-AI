# Polynomial-Linear-Regression-By-The-AI
Hello learners, In this repository I bind my work of Polynomial Linear Regression. Here I attached the applied approach of How to perform Polynomial Regression.
I include all necessary theories in my Python notebook and I try to make the model training process as simple as I can.
So. If you are an ML enthusiast then don't miss it out.
